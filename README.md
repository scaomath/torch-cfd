# Neural Operator-Assisted Computational Fluid Dynamics in PyTorch

![A decaying turbulence (McWilliams 1984)](examples/McWilliams2d.svg)

## Summary 

This repository contains mainly two parts:

### Part I: a native PyTorch port of [Google's Computational Fluid Dynamics package in Jax](https://github.com/google/jax-cfd)
The main changes are documented in the `README.md` under the [`torch_cfd` directory](./torch_cfd/). The most significant changes in all routines include:
  - Routines that rely on the functional programming of Jax have been rewritten to be the PyTorch's tensor-in-tensor-out style, which is arguably more user-friendly to debugging as one can view immediate tensors using Data Wrangler in VS Code.
  - Functions and operators are in general implemented as `nn.Module` like a factory template.
  - Jax-cfd's `funcutils.trajectory` function supports tracking only one field variable (vorticity or velocity). For this port, extra fields computation and tracking are made more accessible, such as time derivatives $\partial_t\boldsymbol{v}$ and PDE residual $R(\boldsymbol{v}):=\boldsymbol{f}-\partial_t \boldsymbol{v}-(\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{v} + \nu \Delta \boldsymbol{v}$.
  - All ops take into consideration the batch dimension of tensors `(b, *, n, m)` regardless of `*` dimension, for example, `(b, T, C, n, n)`, which is similar to PyTorch behavior, not a single trajectory like Google's original Jax-CFD package.

### Part II: Spectral-Refiner: Neural Operator-Assisted Navier-Stokes Equations simulator.
  - The **Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator** (SFNO) is a spacetime tensor-to-tensor learner (or trajectory-to-trajectory), available in the [`fno` directory](./fno). Different components of FNO have been re-implemented keeping the conciseness of the original implementation while allowing modern expansions. We draw inspiration from the [3D FNO in Nvidia's Neural Operator repo](https://github.com/neuraloperator/neuraloperator), [Transformers-based neural operators](https://github.com/thuml/Neural-Solver-Library), as well as Temam's book on functional analysis for the NSE. 
  - Major architectural changes: learnable spatiotemporal positional encodings, layernorm to replace a hard-coded global Gaussian normalizer, and many others. For more details please see [the documentation of the `SFNO` class](./fno/sfno.py#L485). 
  - Data generation for the meta-example of the isotropic turbulence in [McWilliams1984]. After the warmup phase, the energy spectra match the inverse cascade of Kolmogorov flow in a periodic box.
  - Pipelines for the *a posteriori* error estimation to fine-tune the SFNO to reach the scientific computing level of accuracy ($\le 10^{-6}$) in Bochner norm using FLOPs on par with a single evaluation, and only a fraction of FLOPs of a single `.backward()`.
  - [Examples](#examples) can be found below.

## Installation
To install `torch-cfd`'s current release, simply do:
```bash
pip install torch-cfd
```
If one wants to play with the neural operator part, it is recommended to clone this repo and play it locally by creating a venv using `requirements.txt`. Note: using PyTorch version >=2.0.0 is recommended for the broadcasting semantics.
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The data are available at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/scaomath/navier-stokes-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scaomath/navier-stokes-dataset).
Data generation instructions are available in the [SFNO folder](./fno).


## Examples
- Demos of different simulation setups:
  - [2D simulation with a pseudo-spectral solver](./examples/Kolmogrov2d_rk4_cn_forced_turbulence.ipynb)
  - [2D simulation with a finite volume solver](./examples/Kolmogrov2d_rk4_fvm_forced_turbulence.ipynb)
- Demos of Spatiotemporal FNO's training and evaluation using the neural operator-assisted fluid simulation pipelines
  - [Training of SFNO for only 15 epochs for the isotropic turbulence example](./examples/ex2_SFNO_train.ipynb)
  - [Training of SFNO for only ***10*** epochs with 1k samples and reach `1e-2` level of relative error](./examples/ex2_SFNO_train_fnodata.ipynb) using the data in the FNO paper, which to our best knowledge no operator learner can do this in <100 epochs in the small data regime.
  - [Fine-tuning of SFNO on a `256x256` grid for only 50 ADAM iterations to reach `1e-6` residual in the functional norm using FNO data](./examples/ex2_SFNO_finetune_fnodata.ipynb)
  - [Fine-tuning of SFNO on the `256x256` grid for the McWilliams 2d isotropic turbulence](./examples/ex2_SFNO_finetune_McWilliams2d.ipynb)
  - [Training of SFNO for only 5 epoch to match the inverse cascade of Kolmogorov flow](./examples/ex2_SFNO_5ep_spectra.ipynb)
  - [Baseline of FNO3d for fixed step size that requires preloading a normalizer](./examples/ex2_FNO3d_train_normalized.ipynb)

## Licenses
The Apache 2.0 License in the root folder applies to the `torch-cfd` folder of the repo that is inherited from Google's original license file for `Jax-cfd`. The `fno` folder has the MIT license inherited from [NVIDIA's Neural Operator repo](https://github.com/neuraloperator/neuraloperator). Note: the license(s) in the subfolder takes precedence.

## Contributions
PR welcome. Currently, the port of `torch-cfd` currently includes:
- The pseudospectral method for vorticity uses anti-aliasing filtering techniques for nonlinear terms to maintain stability.
- The finite volume method on a MAC grid for velocity, and using the projection scheme to impose the divergence free condition.
- Temporal discretization: Currently only RK4 temporal discretization uses explicit time-stepping for advection and either implicit or explicit time-stepping for diffusion.
- Boundary conditions: only periodic boundary conditions.
